SPDX license expressions for npm package without proper metadata

This package exports an Array of Objects.  Each Object looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "optimist",
  "version": "6.0.1",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

`license` contains a valid SPDX license expression for `version` of package `name`.

`name` may contain a scope, as well as a package name, like `@scope/package`.
